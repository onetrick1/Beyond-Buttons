Beyond Buttons aims to create an affordable and accessible face-controlled application that replaces 
traditional input devices, such as touchscreens, keyboards, and mice, with face-controlled operations 
to help reduce hand-related conditions, improve public hygiene, and provide an alternative method of 
input for those with dexterity limitations.
